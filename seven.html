        All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in
        execution environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming
        language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are
        implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses
        prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
      </li>
      <li>It is a case-sensitive language</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>

      <li>
        Easy to use and Read - Python's syntax is clear and easy to read, making
        it an ideal language for both beginners and experienced programmers.
        This simplicity can lead to faster development and reduce the chances of
        errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dynamically Typed - The data types of variables are determined during
        run-time. We do not need to specify the data type of a variable during
        writing codes.
      </li>
      <li>High-level - High-level language means human readable code.</li>
      <li>
        Compiled and Interpreted - Python code first gets compiled into
        bytecode, and then interpreted line by line. When we download the Python
        in our system form org we download the default implement of Python known
        as CPython. CPython is considered to be Complied and Interpreted both.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garbage Collected - Memory allocation and de-allocation are
        automatically managed. Programmers do not specifically need to manage
        the memory.
      </li>
