      <dt>MEAN Stack</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The MEAN stack is a full stack JavaScript framework used for building
          dynamic web applications. It consists of MongoDB (NoSQL database),
          Express.js (backend framework), Angular (frontend framework), and
          Node.js (runtime environment).

      <dt>MERN Stack</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The MERN stack is similar to the MEAN stack but replaces Angular with
          React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It comprises
          MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, allowing for efficient
          development of single-page applications.

        <p>
          The LAMP stack is a traditional open-source web development solution
          consisting of Linux (operating system), Apache (web server), MySQL
          (relational database management system), and PHP (server-side
          scripting language). It's commonly used for building dynamic websites
          and web applications.

      <dd>
        <p>
          The Python Django stack is a full stack framework for building web
          applications using Python. Django provides a high-level and robust
          toolkit for rapid development, including an ORM (Object-Relational
          Mapper), admin interface, and built-in security features.

      <dd>
        <p>
          Ruby on Rails is a full stack web development framework written in
          Ruby. It emphasizes convention over configuration, allowing developers
          to build web applications quickly and efficiently by following
          established conventions. Rails provides built-in tools for tasks such
          as database management, routing, and asset compilation.
