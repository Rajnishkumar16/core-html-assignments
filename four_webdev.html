    <h3>Web Development</h3>
    <p>
      Web development refers to the overall process of creating websites or web
      applications, including the projectâ€™s design, layout, coding, content
      creation, and functionality. It involves using a combination of
      programming languages, tools, and frameworks to bring a website or web
      application to life. It may also encompass project management activities,
      such as fielding development requests from stakeholders or freelance
      clients. Web programming, on the other hand, specifically refers to the
      coding and scripting of a website, whether the front-end or back-end. It
      primarily involves writing code to handle data, process user inputs, and
      generate dynamic content. A web programmer will rarely, if ever, handle a
      web development project from end to end. They may build a certain section
      of a site or troubleshoot bugs. Understanding this difference has been
      crucial in my career, allowing me to appreciate the depth and breadth of
      skills required in the world of web creation. It's a reminder of the
      diverse talents and expertise that come together to make the digital world
      what it is today.
